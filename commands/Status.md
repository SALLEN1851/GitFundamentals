# git status

The command `git status` is extremely helpful when it comes to checking on the status on your repository. 

Using `git status` will show you what changes are being tracked, aren't being tracked, what commits need to be pushed/pulled, etc. It is basically a status check. 

This command is safe to use any time. 

```
git status
```
